## Description

  This application is a simplified example of multi-agent systems on the example of laptop selection.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;In settings tab you can set how many customers and sellers should be created with the maximum amount of laps which customer can make when he try to find not busy seller.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Preferences tab is for setting the laptop purchase preferences with which we want the customer agent to come back. There is also an option to prioritize a given option so that the agent knows how much we want the option to be fulfilled. There is also a button to start the search or to stop the search in progress. On the right side, in a blank space, the laptops that agents returned with will be displayed with the name, price, link to the website, and the ability to select one of the agents' laptops.   
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Third tab contains the output of what is happening, displays the logs.  
  
  Among the files there is a file `AgentsDB_import.sql` with sample data to be exported, e.g. using phpMyAdmin. It will create the necessary databases and tables.
